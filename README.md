### Hello world
    - runApp() takes a widget and makes it the root of the tree
    
### Basic Widgets
    - Text: lets us run styled text withi  our application
    - Row, Column: create flexible layouts: horizontal (Row) and vertical(Column)
    - Stack: used to place widgets on top of each other, in paint order.
    - Container: lets us create rectangular visual elements. This can have BoxDecoration, background, border or a shadoe, can be also transformed into 3D

    - **  material is a conceptual piece of paper on which the UI appears
